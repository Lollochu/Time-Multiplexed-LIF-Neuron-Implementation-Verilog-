# Time-Multiplexed-LIF-Neuron-Implementation-Verilog-
A Verilog implementation of a resource-efficient neuromorphic system based on the Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) model. Inspired by the architecture of the ODIN processor, this design utilizes Time-Division Multiplexing to manage multiple virtual neurons using a single physical computation core.
